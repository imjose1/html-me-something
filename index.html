                        <h2>Family time </h2>
                        <p>After a long day at work, I like to go home and spent some time with my two wonderful sons and my wife. I like taking the kids out to different places over Saint Louis. It makes me feel amazing to be able to make them happy. My oldest son just recently started second grade, and his very favorite thing to do right now is play and trade Pokemon cards. My youngest is a bit of a wild card, as hes a toddler and not terribly accustumed to listening or following directions yet. He loves cars and Pixar movies. We enjoy eating out as a family, as well as spending time one on one with my wife. My wife and I try to visit local cafes, and diners as much as we can.  </p>

                        <h2>Sports</h2>
                        <p>I have liked and played sports since I was a child. I really enjoy trying new sports, recently I have been trying my hand at golf. I like cardio and I enjoy the stratagy part of the game (using right club, executing the swing, ect). I love soccer, its probably by far my most favorite sport out of the lot, I've been trying to get my oldest son to partake in soccer, but I am not so postive that it will stick. </p>

                         <h2>Computer languages</h2>
                        <p>I knew next to nothing about computer science or language. I used to work and play video games, then I made some friends who happen to live in mexico and loved coding and they introducted me to it. I ended up really loving it after giving it a go. I picked up different courses on line and ready some books to help my self teaching process. I feel very lucky to be able to be included in this class. </p>

                         <h2>Dance</h2>
                        <p>I am Latino, so I really enjoy music and dancing. My wife and I used to take Salasa classes at a club near us, where they would also have salsa night. I really like different types of music and dance. One of the big things that I've gone to over the last few months has been "bollywood night," its a different style of dance as well as music and I've made new friends. </p>

                        <h2>Video games</h2>
                        <p>One of my favorite video game is first person shooting games, to be more specific, Call of Duty. Although the last few games have been severly disapointing. However, even with the disapointment of the last few games, I'm really looking forward to the new one that will be released because it goes back to its roots. I also like tactic games like StarCraft, League of Legends, as well as World Of Warcraft. </p>

                        <h2>Reading about history</h2>
                        <p>I enjoy reading about history. I love learning about ancient civilizations, how they built their monuments, how they lived, what they thought, and how they treated each other. Even something as mundane as what they enjoyed eating for "traditional food" I find intresting. Its really cool to read about how we have evolved with the times, and the way we build things around us to suit our needs.  </p>

                        <h2>Watching video tutorials</h2>
                        <p>Watching video tutorials is probably one of the best ways that I can obtain (and retain) new information. It makes it a lot easier for me to be able to see what other people are doing, in order to be able to process it critically. I also enjoy being able to watch news clips from around the world so I stay updated. </p>
